\section{Background}

Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) (\cite{duane-hmc,neal-hmc}) is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm. Given a target probability distribution — in our case the posterior distribution of a set of variables $\theta$ given independent observations $x \in \D$ — it produces samples by carrying out a random walk over the parameter space using Hamiltonian dynamics.

To begin with prior distribution $p(\theta)$ and likelihood $p(x \mid \theta)$. Using these we define the \emph{potential energy} function $U$:
\begin{equation*}
    U \defeq - \sum_{x \in \D}\log p(x \mid \theta) - \log p(\theta)
\end{equation*}
Note that, using Bayes' rule, we have that the posterior $p(\theta \mid \D) \propto \exp(-U)$. Hamiltonian dynamics introduces an auxiliary set of momentum variables $r$. These dynamics have a physical interpretation in which an object moves about a landscape determined by $U$. We let this object have \emph{mass matrix} $M$. Then $U$ represents the potential energy of the object, and its kinetic energy is given by $\frac 1 2 r^{\mathsf T} M^{-1} r$. The development of the system is governed by the following equations.
\begin{align*}
    \dif\theta &= M^{-1}r \dif t \\
    \dif r &= - \nabla U(\theta) \dif t
\end{align*}

To simulate these continuous dynamics in practice, we must use a discretised version of these equations. To correct for the inaccuracies introduced by doing so, it is necessary to make a \emph{Metropolis-Hastings correction}. A simple algorithm is given in \cref{alg:hmc}.\fxnote{Define $H$}
